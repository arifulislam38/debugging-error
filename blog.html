                <h1>Local Storage and Session Storage: What Are Their Uses?</h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>Local storage:</strong> 
                    Local and session storage are JavaScript APIs that you can use to store data on the client-side. They allow a website to store data on the browser and instruct the browser to access it later on. Depending on your needs, you can use local or session storage to store data. Both storage methods are similar to cookies but without the same privacy concerns surrounding cookies. Therefore, most modern websites prefer to use web storage methods only or combine them with cookies as a fallback.

                    Unlike cookies, local storage and session storage do not send data to the server via HTTP headers. You should use them for client-side functionality only.
                    
                    Additionally, local and session storage each have a storage limit of around 5 MB per domain. They provide more storage than cookies, which only have a capacity of 4 KiB per cookie. <br> <br>

                    <strong>Session Storage:</strong> 
                    A browsing session approximates your use of a website. If you visit a site, browse around for a bit, then turn off your computer, you can think of that time as a single session. Your browser configuration may change this in subtle ways, but a session aims to represent the chunk of time you interact with a site.

                    Session storage is unique to each browser tab. If you open a new tab and navigate to the same site, you'll start a new session with its own storage. However, if you use a "duplicate tab" feature in your browser, that may reuse the same session. You can't rely too much on the specific details of a "session". Instead, focus on the core concept: session storage is temporary.
